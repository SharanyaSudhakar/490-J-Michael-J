# 490-J-Michael-J
This is the collebrative project for CSE 490 J fall 2018
For part one, I just created the town street scene with free assets got from the asset store
For part two, I made animation to show audience around my scene with cinemachine, giving both drone shot and the first person shot;
For part three, I pushed the project onto the github, preparing for light and post-processing
For part four, I made the lighing and post-produced the scene to be more like a "late-night-town" scene.
